abstract = {{Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful approach based on deep sequencing of cDNA libraries generated from ribosome-protected RNA fragments to explore the translatome of a cell, and is especially useful for the detection of small proteins (50–100 amino acids) that are recalcitrant to many standard biochemical and in silico approaches. While pipelines are available to analyze Ribo-seq data, none are designed explicitly for the automatic processing and analysis of data from bacteria, nor are they focused on the discovery of unannotated open reading frames (ORFs).We present HRIBO (High-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq), a workflow to enable reproducible and high-throughput analysis of bacterial Ribo-seq data. The workflow performs all required pre-processing and quality control steps. Importantly, HRIBO outputs annotation-independent ORF predictions based on two complementary bacteria-focused tools, and integrates them with additional feature information and expression values. This facilitates the rapid and high-confidence discovery of novel ORFs and their prioritization for functional characterization.HRIBO is a free and open source project available under the GPL-3 license at: https://github.com/RickGelhausen/HRIBO.}}

abstract = {In contrast to extensively studied prokaryotic 'small' 
            transcriptomes (encompassing all small noncoding RNAs), 
            small proteomes (here defined as including proteins </=70 
            aa) are only now entering the limelight. The absence of a 
            complete small protein catalogue in most prokaryotes 
            precludes our understanding of how these molecules affect 
            physiology. So far, archaeal genomes have not yet been 
            analyzed broadly with a dedicated focus on small proteins. 
            Here, we present a combinatorial approach, integrating 
            experimental data from small protein-optimized mass 
            spectrometry (MS) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), to 
            generate a high confidence inventory of small proteins in 
            the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. We demonstrate by MS 
            and Ribo-seq that 67% of the 317 annotated small open 
            reading frames (sORFs) are translated under standard growth 
            conditions. Furthermore, annotation-independent analysis of 
            Ribo-seq data showed ribosomal engagement for 47 novel sORFs 
            in intergenic regions. A total of seven of these were also 
            detected by proteomics, in addition to an eighth novel small 
            protein solely identified by MS. We also provide independent 
            experimental evidence in vivo for the translation of 12 
            sORFs (annotated and novel) using epitope tagging and 
            western blotting, underlining the validity of our 
            identification scheme. Several novel sORFs are conserved in 
            Haloferax species and might have important functions. Based 
            on our findings, we conclude that the small proteome of H. 
            volcanii is larger than previously appreciated, and that 
            combining MS with Ribo-seq is a powerful approach for the 
            discovery of novel small protein coding genes in archaea.}

abstract = {The soil-dwelling plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti is 
            a major model organism of Alphaproteobacteria. Despite 
            numerous detailed OMICS studies, information about small 
            open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins (SEPs) is largely 
            missing, because sORFs are poorly annotated and SEPs are 
            hard to detect experimentally. However, given that SEPs can 
            fulfill important functions, identification of translated 
            sORFs is critical for analyzing their roles in bacterial 
            physiology. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) can detect 
            translated sORFs with high sensitivity, but is not yet 
            routinely applied to bacteria because it must be adapted for 
            each species. Here, we established a Ribo-seq procedure for 
            S. meliloti 2011 based on RNase I digestion and detected 
            translation for 60% of the annotated coding sequences during 
            growth in minimal medium. Using ORF prediction tools based 
            on Ribo-seq data, subsequent filtering, and manual curation, 
            the translation of 37 non-annotated sORFs with </= 70 amino 
            acids was predicted with confidence. The Ribo-seq data were 
            supplemented by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from three 
            sample preparation approaches and two integrated 
            proteogenomic search database (iPtgxDB) types. Searches 
            against standard and 20-fold smaller Ribo-seq data-informed 
            custom iPtgxDBs confirmed 47 annotated SEPs and identified 
            11 additional novel SEPs. Epitope tagging and Western blot 
            analysis confirmed the translation of 15 out of 20 SEPs 
            selected from the translatome map. Overall, by combining MS 
            and Ribo-seq approaches, the small proteome of S. meliloti 
            was substantially expanded by 48 novel SEPs. Several of them 
            are part of predicted operons and/or are conserved from 
            Rhizobiaceae to Bacteria, suggesting important physiological 
            functions.}

abstract = {Small proteins encoded by short open reading frames (ORFs) with 50 codons or fewer are emerging as an important class of cellular macromolecules in diverse organisms. However, they often evade detection by proteomics or in silico methods. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) has revealed widespread translation in genomic regions previously thought to be non-coding, driving the development of ORF detection tools using Ribo-seq data. However, only a handful of tools have been designed for bacteria, and these have not yet been systematically compared. Here, we aimed to identify tools that use Ribo-seq data to correctly determine the translational status of annotated bacterial ORFs and also discover novel translated regions with high sensitivity. To this end, we generated a large set of annotated ORFs from four diverse bacterial organisms, manually labeled for their translation status based on Ribo-seq data, which are available for future benchmarking studies. This set was used to investigate the predictive performance of seven Ribo-seq-based ORF detection tools (REPARATION\_blast, DeepRibo, Ribo-TISH, PRICE, smORFer, ribotricer and SPECtre), as well as IRSOM, which uses coding potential and RNA-seq coverage only. DeepRibo and REPARATION\_blast robustly predicted translated ORFs, including sORFs, with no significant difference for ORFs in close proximity to other genes versus stand-alone genes. However, no tool predicted a set of novel, experimentally verified sORFs with high sensitivity. Start codon predictions with smORFer show the value of initiation site profiling data to further improve the sensitivity of ORF prediction tools in bacteria. Overall, we find that bacterial tools perform well for sORF detection, although there is potential for improving their performance, applicability, usability and reproducibility.}

abstract = {{Small proteins are an emerging class of gene products with diverse roles in bacterial physiology. However, a full understanding of their importance has been hampered by insufficient genome annotations and a lack of comprehensive characterization in microbes other than Escherichia coli. We have taken an integrative approach to accelerate the discovery of small proteins and their putative virulence-associated functions in Salmonella Typhimurium. We merged the annotated small proteome of Salmonella with new small proteins predicted with in silico and experimental approaches. We then exploited existing and newly generated global datasets that provide information on small open reading frame expression during infection of epithelial cells (dual RNA-seq), contribution to bacterial fitness inside macrophages (Transposon-directed insertion sequencing), and potential engagement in molecular interactions (Grad-seq). This integrative approach suggested a new role for the small protein MgrB beyond its known function in regulating PhoQ. We demonstrate a virulence and motility defect of a Salmonella delta-mgrB mutant and reveal an effect of MgrB in regulating the Salmonella transcriptome and proteome under infection-relevant conditions. Our study highlights the power of interpreting available omics datasets with a focus on small proteins, and may serve as a blueprint for a data integration-based survey of small proteins in diverse bacteria.}}
